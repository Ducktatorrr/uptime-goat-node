  # Welcome to Uptime GOAT, Cryptards

  ## Usage instructions

  This isn’t your typical crypto playground—it’s a proving ground. No fast cash, no easy exits. Just 24 hours of consecutive uptime standing between you and your earnings. Here, hustle isn’t a choice; it’s a requirement.

  You become an Uptime GOAT only after you achieve those 24 hours of consecutive uptime. Until then, you’re just a plebe. You’ll run a program that sends a report with your unique token every single minute. Miss a report, and you’re back to square one. The rules are straightforward... no rewards until you hit that milestone, and no cashing out until you maintain a flawless record for a full week.

  Uptime GOAT is for the relentless, the obsessed, and the unapologetically committed. If you think you have what it takes, prove it. Because in Uptime GOAT, it’s uptime or nothing.

  Are you in, or are you out?
